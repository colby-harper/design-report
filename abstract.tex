Taking group photos during important events is a common practice. Group photos are taken to remember cheerful times when people had opportunity to meet many other people. However, an unappealing facial experience of one person can easily ruin the entire photo. Capturing the wrong moments when a person doesn't look attractive can leave him/her displeased from the complete event experience. A solution is to develop a mobile app that captures the moment when everyone is smiling with eyes wide open. Our solution aims to develop an iPhone app that will preclude users from worrying about not having a great group picture.
