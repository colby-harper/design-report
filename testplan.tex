\chapter{Test Plan}
Unit testing will be done throughout the quarter from Week 1-10 on every new functionality we implement. We plan to perform a lot of unit testing from week 1-5. Unit testing is suitable during this period because we will be heavily invested in implementing the individual functions that make our system. From week 5-7, we combine smaller functions into a full-scale working application. We will perform a lot of black-box testing and system testing to evaluate our product. From week 7-10, we will scale up the amount of our test data and perform stress testing. We plan to use group photos datasets to test the smiley-face recognition feature of our system. Once we combine that feature with iPhones photo capturing feature, we will take photos using our iPhones to verify that our system works.
